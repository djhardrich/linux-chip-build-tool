# This script bundles the rootfs into a tar archive that preserves permissions.
# This is then copied to the shared /vagrant folder.
# The compiled uboot loader is also copied to /vagrant.
#
# This tar MUST be decompressed as root on the host, or else file permissions
# will not be preserved and binaries such as sudo will not execute on the
# target device!
#
# This archive CANNOT be decompressed into the /vagrant folder, because
# the /vagrant folder will overwrite permissions in a way that will also break
# sudo and other binaries on the target device.
